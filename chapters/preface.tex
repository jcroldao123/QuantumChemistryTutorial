This manual was developed with the goal of supporting students, researchers, and practitioners in the field of quantum chemistry and molecular simulations. It compiles, in a unified and didactic way, practical instructions and theoretical notes on some of the most widely used computational chemistry packages: Gaussian, ORCA, Dalton, GAMESS, Turbomole, Molcas, FCclasses, GROMACS, and LAMMPS.

The content reflects the author's experience in teaching, research supervision, and collaborative projects — with emphasis on usability, reproducibility, and automation of simulations. Many of the scripts and examples presented here come directly from real research contexts and student theses. The manual is meant to be dynamic. As tools evolve, so will this tutorial — especially thanks to the valuable feedback from students and colleagues who apply it in their own workflows.

\textbf{To the students:} never hesitate to explore, question, and break things (on purpose). Science moves forward through curiosity.
